Introduction
Smart Alerts ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Smart Alerts mobile application (the "Service").

By using Smart Alerts, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

Information We Collect
Personal and Account Information

Account Identifiers: When you sign in (anonymous or authenticated), we store a unique User ID in the cloud. If you use Google or Apple sign-in, your display name and email may also be associated with your account for purchase and entitlement management.

Subscription & Entitlement Data: Your subscription tier (Basic, Plus, Pro), promo code usage, and subscription platform (Android/iOS) are tracked in our Firebase backend to deliver premium features and manage upgrades.

Reminder and App Preferences

Reminder Data: Reminders, notification times, custom notes, and repeat schedules.

App Preferences: Chosen notification sounds, themes, and settings.

Usage and Analytics

Usage Data: Feature usage, screen navigation patterns, upgrade actions, and promo code redemption are recorded as anonymous, aggregated events in Firebase Analytics for product improvement.

Promo Code Tracking: When you redeem a public or private promo code, information about the code, tier, discount, and platform is tracked in an analytics event, but not linked to personal content within your reminders.

Device & Technical Information

Device Identifiers: Device or session tokens for authentication and push notification delivery.

Platform Information: Operating system type (iOS/Android).

App Performance Data: Crash reports and performance metrics (anonymous).

Firebase Data

App Icons: Downloaded from Firebase Storage for UI.

App Database: Curated list of app metadata (read-only).

How We Use Your Information
Core Functionality

Local Storage: Your reminders and notification schedules are always stored locally and are never uploaded or analyzed for content.

Cloud Storage for Subscription: Your subscription, promo, and entitlement status are securely stored in Firestore to manage access and restore purchases across devices.

Notifications: Device tokens and IDs are used solely to deliver reminders.

Service Improvement & Analytics

Analytics: We use Firebase Analytics to understand app usage patterns, such as which features are used, which promo codes are redeemed, and how users transition between tiers. This data is used in aggregate and is not tied to content in your reminders.

Bug Fixes & Optimization: Crash reports and aggregate performance metrics are used to improve app stability and performance, never including reminder or content data.

Data Storage and Security
Local Storage

Device-Only Reminder Content: All reminder and note data remain on your device and are not sent to us or any third party.

App Deletion: Removing the app deletes all locally-stored reminder data. Cloud-based subscription/account data may persist for legal/auditing purposes in compliance with applicable laws.

Cloud Storage (Firestore & Google Sign-in)

User Accounts & Entitlements: Your subscription status, associated email (if using Google/Apple sign-in), purchase entitlements, platform, and promo code redemptions are associated with your unique account in Firestore.

Authentication: Uses Firebase Authentication (anonymous, Google, or Apple sign-in) to confirm and restore entitlements across reinstalls or devices.

Data Minimization: No reminder contents, app notes, or to-do lists are ever uploaded to our servers.

Security Measures

Encryption: All server communication (including analytics) uses HTTPS.

Cloud Security: Firestore and Firebase Authentication enforce access controls so only you (the authenticated user) can access or update your subscription/account data.

Data Sharing
We DO NOT Share User Content

No Reminder Sharing: Reminder content and personal notes are never accessed, collected, or shared.

No Third-Party Sales: User content and account data are never sold or shared with advertisers or external brokers.

Aggregate Usage Analytics Only: Product improvement decisions are made using statistics and trends, without reference to individual user content.

Legal & Safety Exceptions

We may disclose aggregate or account data if required:

Legal requirements: To comply with laws or valid legal processes.

Safety & Integrity: To protect users, the app, or the company.

Your Privacy Rights and Control
Access & Correction: You can view or correct account-related details (email or display name) via your sign-in provider.

Right to Erasure: Delete your account via the app or by request; all cloud account data (entitlements, subscription, and promo history) will be removed where permitted by law.

Data Portability: You can retrieve your reminder data by using your device's native backup system.

Settings Control: All notification, reminder, and local data remain under your direct device control.

Account Data: Linked email/name (if any) are only used for account restoration and entitlement purposes.

Children's Privacy
Smart Alerts is safe for all ages:

Reminder Content Privacy: Never uploaded.

Account/Analytics Data: Used only as described above and not for profiling individuals under age 16 for advertising.

No Messaging or Social Features: No communication between users.

International Users
Cloud Account Data: Account data (entitlement, promo, email) may be stored in the United States or other regions via Google's infrastructure, subject to strict privacy and security controls.

Local Reminder Data: Always stays resident on your device.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We will announce major changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this policy regularly.

Third-Party Services
App Functionality

Google Firebase Storage/Firestore: Manages app icons, entitlement status, promo codes, and user subscription/account records.

Firebase Authentication: For account creation/sign-in.

Apple Push Notification Service / Google Cloud Messaging: For notifications.

App Improvement (Aggregate Data Only)

Firebase Analytics: Tracks feature usage, upgrade flows, and promo code redemptions (never uploads reminder/note content).

Firebase Crashlytics: Monitors errors, not user content.

Important: Your personal reminders are never transmitted to us or any third party. Only account-related (subscription, promo, entitlement) and anonymized analytics events are processed off-device.
